# Stream Processing Demo Library

The term "stream processing" might sound intimidating to many people. We often hear statements like:

- "Stream processing is too difficult to learn and use!"
- "Stream processing is very expensive!"
- "I don’t see any business use cases for stream processing!""

_**However, we believe this isn't true.**_


Streaming data is everywhere, generated from operational databases, messaging queues, IoT devices, and many other sources. People can leverage modern stream processing technology to easily address classic real-world problems, using SQL as the programming language.

In this repository, we provide a series of executable demos demonstrating how stream processing can be applied in practical scenarios.

We categorize the use cases into four groups:

1. Querying and processing event streaming data
2. Bringing analytics closer to operational databases
3. Real-time ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
4. Solution demonstrations

We use RisingWave as the default system for running these demos. _**All you need is a laptop - no cluster is required.**_

Any comments are welcome. Happy streaming!
