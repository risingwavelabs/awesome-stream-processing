The term "stream processing" might sound intimidating to many people. We often hear statements like:

- "Stream processing is too difficult to learn and use!" 😱
- "Stream processing is very expensive!" 😱
- "I don’t see any business use cases for stream processing!" 😱

_**However, we believe this isn't true.**_ ❌


Streaming data is everywhere, generated from operational databases, messaging queues, IoT devices, and many other sources. People can leverage modern stream processing technology to easily address classic real-world problems, using SQL as the programming language.

In this repository, we provide a series of executable demos demonstrating how stream processing can be applied in practical scenarios:

0. [**Getting started ✅**](get-started/)
	* Install RisingWave, Kafka, and PostgreSQL, and run minimal toy examples
1. [**Querying and processing event streaming data ✅**](query-process-streaming-data/)
	* Directly query data stored in event streaming systems (e.g., Kafka, Redpanda)
	* Continuously ingest and analyze data from event streaming systems
2. [**Bringing analytics closer to operational databases ✅**](bring-analytics-closer-to-odb/)
	* Offload event-driven queries (e.g., materialized views and triggers) from operational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
3. [**Real-time ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) ✅**](real-time-etl/)
	* Perform ETL continuously and incrementally
4. [**Solution demonstrations ✅**](solution-demos/)
	* A collection of demos showcasing how stream processing is used in real-world applications

We use [RisingWave](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave) as the default stream processing system to run these demos. We also assume that you have [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) and/or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) installed and possess basic knowledge of how to use these systems. **These demos have been verified on Ubuntu.**

_**All you need is a laptop**_ 💻 - _**no cluster is required.**_

Any comments are welcome. Happy streaming!
