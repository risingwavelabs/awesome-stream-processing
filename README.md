The term "stream processing" might sound intimidating to many people. We often hear statements like:

- "Stream processing is too difficult to learn and use!" 😱
- "Stream processing is very expensive!" 😱
- "I don’t see any business use cases for stream processing!" 😱

_**However, we believe this isn't true.**_ ❌


Streaming data is everywhere, generated from operational databases, messaging queues, IoT devices, and many other sources. People can leverage modern stream processing technology to easily address classic real-world problems, using SQL as the programming language.

In this repository, we provide a series of executable demos demonstrating how stream processing can be applied in practical scenarios.

We categorize the use cases into four groups:

1. **Querying and processing event streaming data ✅**
	* Directly query data stored in event streaming systems (e.g., Kafka, Redpanda, etc)
	* Continuously ingest and analyze data from event streaming systems (e.g., Kafka, Redpanda, etc)
2. **Bringing analytics closer to operational databases ✅**
	* Offload event-driven workloads like materialized views and triggers) from operational databases
3. **Real-time ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) ✅**
	* Perform ETL continuously and incrementally
4. **Solution demonstrations ✅**
	* A collection of demos showcasing how stream processing is used in real-world applications

We use [RisingWave](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave) as the default stream processing system for running these demos.

_**All you need is a laptop**_ 💻 - _**no cluster is required.**_

Any comments are welcome. Happy streaming!
