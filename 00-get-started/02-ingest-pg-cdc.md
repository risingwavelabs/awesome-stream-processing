# Ingest data from PostgreSQL CDC into RisingWave

Now that you have the necessary systems installed for stream processing, let us use RisingWave to consume and analyze data from PostgreSQL. CDC (change data capture) refers to the process of identifying and capturing data changes in a database and delivering the changes to another service in real time. In this case, this means that any changes made in the PostgreSQL database will be reflected automatically in RisingWave.

If you need help installing these systems, refer to [Install Kafka, RisingWave, and PostgreSQL](00-install-rw-kafka-pg.md).

## Create a table in PostgreSQL

First, ensure you have downloaded and started the PostgreSQL server. For more information, check the [installation guide of PostgreSQL](00-install-rw-kafka-pg.md#install-postgresql) in our "Get Started" chapter.

Next, create a table and populate it with some data in PostgreSQL. The following creates a table `users` that has the columns `id`, `name`, and `age`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT
);
```

Insert some data into the table.

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES
    ('John Doe', 25),
    ('Jane Smith', 30),
    ('Bob Johnson', 22);
```

## Use RisingWave to process the data

Now that PostgreSQL is set up, we can move over to RisingWave to ingest CDC data from PostgreSQL. Ensure that you have RisingWave up and running. For more information, check the [installation guide of RisingWave](00-install-rw-kafka-pg.md#install-risingwave) in our "Get Started" chapter.

To read CDC data from the table we just created, use the following SQL query. We create a table `pg_users` in RisingWave that reads data from the `users` table created in PostgreSQL. Remember to fill in the username and password accordingly. If you created your table in a different database and schema, remember to adjust the parameter values.

```sql
CREATE TABLE pg_users (
    id integer,
    age integer,
    name varchar,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
) WITH (
    connector = 'postgres-cdc',
    hostname = 'localhost',
    port = '5432',
    username = '<USERNAME>',
    password = '<PASSWORD>',
    database.name = 'postgres',
    schema.name = 'public',
    table.name = 'users'
);
```

As an example, for the [newly created user](#optional-create-a-database-user) `rw` with password as `abc123`, run the following SQL.
```sql
CREATE TABLE pg_users (
    id integer,
    age integer,
    name varchar,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
) WITH (
    connector = 'postgres-cdc',
    hostname = 'localhost',
    port = '5432',
    username = 'rw',
    password = 'abc123',
    database.name = 'postgres',
    schema.name = 'public',
    table.name = 'users'
);
```

Now you can query from the table to see the data, which should be the same as the PostgreSQL table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_users;
```

The results will look like the following.

```terminal
 id | age |    name     
----+-----+-------------
  1 |  25 | John Doe
  2 |  30 | Jane Smith
  3 |  22 | Bob Johnson
(3 rows)
```

Any updates made to the `users` table in PostgreSQL will automatically be reflected in the `pg_users` table in RisingWave. You can test this by going to the PostgreSQL database, inserting some data, and querying from the `pg_users` table again in RisingWave.
