```

## Initialize the environemt
```bash
## Setup RisingWave, Iceberg with Rest Catalog, Clickhouse via docker compose
./start.sh
```

## Prepare sample data for the demo
```bash
./prepare.sh
```

## Connect to RW / Clickhouse / SPARK to run the demo SQLs in sql/
```bash
## Run the following two commands in two terminals at the same time.

# Terminal 1: Use spark sql to run DML in sql/spark_dml.sql interactively
./client.sh dml-spark

# Terminal 2: Watch the sql/ch.sql result via Clickhouse client
./client.sh watch-ch
